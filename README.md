I’ve developed an interactive IPL dashboard that provides key insights and visualizations from the IPL seasons. This dashboard features:

Season-wise analysis: Breakdown of teams' performances in each IPL season.
Matches won by teams based on batting first or fielding first since 2008.
Toss decision impact on match outcomes.
Top venues with the highest number of matches and win percentages.
Title winners over the years, with highlights of major winning teams.
Top Man of the Match (MoM) winners with individual performance stats.
Using Excel, I leveraged data visualization techniques to create charts that allow users to analyze trends, team performances, and match outcomes in a visually engaging way. 
It’s a comprehensive tool for IPL enthusiasts and analysts to dive deep into the tournament's history!
